# Decision-Tree-ID3
Implementation of Decision tree based classifier model using ID3 algorithm

In this project, we have to classify the final Grade on a scale of 0 to 20 using the given attributes in the dataset. First, we divided the dataset randomly in 2:1 ratio using the Bootstrap Sampling method, and then we built the classifier model based on the ID3 Algorithm by training the model with train data set and then we calculated the performance of the model in terms of Accuracy, F1 score, Precision, Recall. We also performed the K cross-validation method to train the model and calculated the performance of the model in terms of Accuracy, F1 score, Precision, Recall.
